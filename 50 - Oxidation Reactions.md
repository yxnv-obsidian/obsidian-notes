- Oxidation Reactions
	- In Oxidation-Reduction Reactions, electrons move between atoms
	- Reduction - 
		- **Gain** of electrons
		- Even though it is called a "Reduction", it is gaining electrons which reduces it charge.
	- Oxidation -
		- **Loss** of electrons
		- Losing Electrons means that the charge of the Ion becomes higher and goes up.
	
	- Examples

			- In this example, Na is Positively charged with 11 protons and 10 electrons
				- This means that Na has a charge of +1
			- In this example, Cl is Negatively charged with 17 protons and 18 electrons
				- This means that Cl has a charge of -1
			- Sodium is oxidized meaning it loses an electron.
			- Chlorine is reduced it gains an electron.![[Introduction to Oxidation Reduction (Redox) Reactions 9-58 screenshot.png|Introduction to Oxidation Reduction (Redox) Reactions 9-58 screenshot.png]]

- SUMMARY

	- Redox reactions involve electron transfer between atoms. Oxidation is the loss of electrons, while reduction is the gain of electrons. Oxidation and reduction are separate half reactions, which combine to form the complete reaction. Oxidation numbers indicate electron changes in atoms.
