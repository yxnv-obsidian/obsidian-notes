1. Determine Oxidation Numbers
2. Figure out what is being oxidized and reduced
3. Write half reactions
4. Balance atoms other than O and H (do them last)
5. Add H2O to balance O and H+ to balance H
6. Add electrons to balance charges
7. Multiply half reactions to make the number of electrons equal in both
8. Add the half reactions cancelling stuff that appears on both sides
- Do a final Check to make sure everything balances.
